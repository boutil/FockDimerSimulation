# Fock Dimers Limit Shapes

This is a repository accompanying the paper [1](archiv.org/toComeSoon). It consists of these essential parts:

1. Schottky uniformizations for definition of an M-curve and computation of corresponding differentials and theta functions. This uses the [jtem riemann project](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/geometrie/jtem/riemann/).
2. Creation of Z2 and Hex lattices with Fock weights corresponding to a choice of Harnack data.
3. Simulation and visualization of dimer configurations on a weighted graph. Simulation can run on a CUDA enabled GPU or multithreaded on CPU.
4. Calculation of limiting arctic curves and height functions based on Harnack data.
